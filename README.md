# MedVit üè• - Scientific research uses AI and deep learning technology to classify medical images

Medical image classification using <span style="color:red"><b>deep learning</b></span> is a critical field that assists physicians in diagnosing diseases such as <span style="color:red"><b>pneumonia</b></span>, <span style="color:red"><b>tuberculosis</b></span>, or <span style="color:red"><b>cancer</b></span> from <span style="color:red"><b>X-ray</b></span>, <span style="color:red"><b>MRI</b></span>, or <span style="color:red"><b>ultrasound</b></span> images. 
In <span style="color:red"><b>Vietnam</b></span>, the demand for <span style="color:red"><b>AI applications in healthcare</b></span> is rapidly increasing due to a shortage of <span style="color:red"><b>radiologists</b></span> and the growing volume of <span style="color:red"><b>medical imaging data</b></span>. 
This study focuses on developing and improving <span style="color:red"><b>deep learning models</b></span> to enhance the <span style="color:red"><b>accuracy</b></span> and <span style="color:red"><b>efficiency</b></span> of medical image classification. The objective is to reduce <span style="color:red"><b>diagnostic time</b></span>, improve model performance on <span style="color:red"><b>real-world datasets</b></span>, and make <span style="color:red"><b>AI tools</b></span> more applicable in <span style="color:red"><b>clinical settings</b></span>.
The resulting system aims to support physicians in making faster and more accurate diagnoses, promote the adoption of <span style="color:red"><b>deep learning in healthcare</b></span>, and demonstrate its potential in <span style="color:red"><b>clinical decision support systems</b></span> in Vietnam.
