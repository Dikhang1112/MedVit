# MedVit - Scientific research uses AI and deep learning technology to classify medical images
Medical image classification using deep learning is a critical field that assists physicians in diagnosing diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or cancer from X-ray, MRI, or ultrasound images. In Vietnam, the demand for AI applications in healthcare is rapidly increasing due to a shortage of radiologists and the growing volume of medical imaging data. This study focuses on developing and improving deep learning models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of medical image classification. The objective is to reduce diagnostic time, improve model performance on real-world datasets, and make AI tools more applicable in clinical settings. The resulting system aims to support physicians in making faster and more accurate diagnoses, promote the adoption of deep learning in healthcare, and demonstrate its potential in clinical decision support systems in Vietnam.
